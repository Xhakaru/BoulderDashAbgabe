# BoulderDashAbgabe
 The exercise was to create an own version of BoulderDash C64

the controls are:
movement:
W -- upwards
A -- to the left
S -- downwards
D -- to the right

Shift + movement control -- eat/collect without moving
Backspace -- kill ur self (stuck or to reset the level)

in general:
there are 3 stages 
for each stage you have to collect rubys to open the door
watch out, the stones and rubys could hit your head
at stage 2 & 3 there are monsters too
for each stage you have 150 seconds
the timer has cool features when you start running out of time
if you complete all 3 stages you see a crazy animation
GOOD LUCK HAVE FUN!!!
